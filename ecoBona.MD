3. **Add Vinegar**:
   - Measure and mix in **2.6 fluid ounces of white vinegar**.
4. **Incorporate Isopropyl Alcohol**:
   - Add **3.8 fluid ounces of isopropyl alcohol** for quick drying.
5. **Add the Soap Solution**:
   - Slowly stir in **3.8 fluid ounces of soap blend** to avoid excessive foaming.
6. **Include Glycerol/Propylene Glycol**:
   - Add **1.3 fluid ounces of glycerol or propylene glycol** to protect the hardwood finish.

### Notes:
- **Storage**: Store in a sealed container, preferably opaque, to prevent the hydrogen peroxide from breaking down due to light exposure.
- **Dilution for Use**: If needed, dilute the cleaner further in the botvac’s tank (e.g., 1 part cleaner to 2 parts distilled water).

### Key Points to Consider When Testing:
#### **1. Check Streaking**:
   - Test on a small, inconspicuous area of your hardwood floor.
   - If streaking occurs:
     - Slightly reduce the soap concentration (e.g., to 2.5%).
     - Dilute the formula further during application (e.g., 1:1 with water in the botvac's tank).

#### **2. pH Balance**:
   - Test the pH using pH strips or a digital meter. It should ideally be around **5.5–6**.
   - If the pH is too low (acidic), add a bit more baking soda (0.1–0.2%).
   - If the pH is too high (alkaline), add a tiny amount of citric acid (or a bit more vinegar).

#### **3. Drying Performance**:
   - The isopropyl alcohol will speed up drying. If drying is still too slow, you can increase IPA to **4%** (reducing water slightly).

#### **4. Storage**:
   - Store the cleaner in a sealed, opaque container to preserve the hydrogen peroxide (light can degrade it).
