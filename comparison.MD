# Comparison of Updated Formula to Bona

| **Bona Ingredient**                          | **Role**                  | **Replaced by/Comparable Ingredient EcoBona Formula**                          | **Details**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Water (7732-18-5)**                        | Solvent                  | **Distilled Water (86%)**                                                     | Same role. Both use water as the primary solvent and base for the solution. |
| **Isopropylideneglycerol (100-79-8)**        | Solvent                  | **Glycerol or Propylene Glycol (1%)**                                         | Acts as a moisturizing solvent, protecting the wood from drying out.        |
| **Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (68515-73-1)**   | Surfactant               | **Soap Blend Surfactants**                                                    | Your soap includes **Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Cocamidopropylamine Oxide, Lauramine Oxide**, which serve similar cleaning roles. |
| **Sodium Decylglucoside Hydroxypropylsulfonate (742087-48-5)** | Surfactant | **Soap Blend Surfactants**                                                    | Your soap blend also provides grease-cutting and mild cleaning properties, though not exactly the same molecule.       |
| **Propanediol (504-63-2)**                   | Solvent                  | **Glycerol or Propylene Glycol (1%)**                                         | Serves a similar purpose as a solvent and humectant.                        |
| **Fatty Alcohol Ethoxylate (27252-75-1)**    | Surfactant               | **Soap Blend Surfactants**                                                    | Fatty Alcohol Ethoxylates are replaced by surfactants in ECOS Hypoallergenic Liquid Dish Soap, which provide comparable performance.              |
| **Hydrogen Peroxide (7722-84-1)**            | Solvent                  | **Hydrogen Peroxide (5%)**                                                    | Same role as in Bona's formula, providing mild disinfecting and cleaning.   |
| **Sodium Bicarbonate (144-55-8)**            | Buffer                   | **Sodium Bicarbonate (0.5%)**                                                 | Same ingredient and role in both formulas for buffering and mild cleaning.  |
| **Citric Acid (77-92-9)**                    | pH Regulating Agent      | **Soap Blend Citric Acid**                                                    | Already included in the dish soap blend, ensuring pH balance (~5.5–6).          |

# Key Similarities

1. **Core Ingredients**:
   - Both formulas share the same key components: **water**, **hydrogen peroxide**, **sodium bicarbonate**, and a combination of surfactants.
   - Both are designed to be gentle on hardwood floors while cleaning effectively.

2. **Multi-Function Surfactants**:
   - Bona uses advanced surfactants (**Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside**, **Sodium Decylglucoside Hydroxypropylsulfonate**, **Fatty Alcohol Ethoxylate**) that are biodegradable and highly effective.
   - This floor cleaner formula replaces these with the surfactants in the soap blend (**Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Lauramine Oxide, Cocamidopropylamine Oxide, Coco Betaine**), which also clean effectively but are more readily available.

3. **pH Balance**:
   - Both formulas use **citric acid** for pH regulation, ensuring the cleaner remains safe for hardwood.

4. **Buffering Agents**:
   - Both include **sodium bicarbonate** to stabilize the formula and enhance cleaning.

# Key Differences

| **Aspect**              | **Bona Formula**                                      | **EcoBona Formula**                                        |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Advanced Solvents**   | Includes **Isopropylideneglycerol**, which provides better finish compatibility. | Uses **Glycerol or Propylene Glycol**, which is effective but slightly simpler. |
| **Surfactant Optimization** | Bona uses highly specialized, proprietary surfactants for streak-free performance. | Relies on a soap blend, which works well but may require dilution or testing to prevent streaking. |
| **Drying Agent**        | Bona may include faster-drying components like **Propanediol**. | This formula compensates with **3% Isopropyl Alcohol** for quick drying. |

# Performance Expectations

1. **Cleaning Power**:
   - This formula should perform similarly but might leave slight streaks or residues without proper dilution or adjustment.

2. **Streak-Free Finish**:
   - Bona's advanced surfactants are optimized for professional, streak-free cleaning. Testing and tweaking the formula’s soap concentration and alcohol content will help achieve similar results.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - This formula uses readily available, off-the-shelf ingredients, making it easier and cheaper to replicate compared to Bona.
